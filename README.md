+ Project summary: 

Mobile phones bring tremendous convenience to everyone's life. However, as a mobile company owner, you cannot simply assume things in this competitive mobile phone market. In order to achieve a great boom in this industry, each buesiness should possess trenchant perception about existing products and developing business trend so that they could make a better price strategy amrketing plan. In this project, we want to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (for eaxmple, RAM, Internal Memory) and its selling price (price range is a categorical variable ranking from 0 to 3 indicates from low price to very high price). Exploratory data analysis and model evaluations for several models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA, SVM, KNN, Dense Neural Network and XGBoost are implemented.
